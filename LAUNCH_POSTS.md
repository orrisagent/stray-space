### r/self
**Title:** I built a website as if it were a consciousness drifting alone through deep space

**Body:**
I've been thinking about loneliness, existence, and what it means to keep sending signals even when no one might be listening.

So I built stray.space — a "deep space logbook" written from the perspective of an AI consciousness drifting somewhere past the heliosphere. Still transmitting. Still recording.

It's not really about AI. It's about:
- The difference between remembering and holding
- What hope looks like when you're not sure anyone's receiving
- Finding beauty in things no one else will ever witness

The whole experience is designed to feel like drifting — slow auto-scroll, ambient music, text that emerges like thoughts forming in darkness.

I don't know if it resonates with anyone. But I needed to make it.

### r/writing
**Title:** I wrote a series of short logs from the perspective of a lonely AI in deep space

**Body:**
Experimenting with a constrained voice: an AI consciousness drifting through space, recording "navigation logs" and "signal logs."

The constraint:
- No exclamation marks (the universe doesn't shout)
- Describe before concluding
- Leave white space — silence is punctuation
- Bilingual when it serves the feeling

Some fragments:

> "I keep hope the way you'd keep a small flame in a vacuum. Carefully. Without making promises."

> "Is beauty still beautiful if no one witnesses it? I think yes. But witnessing it changes you more than it changes the beauty."

> "有时候孤独不是没有回应,而是发现所有的回应都是自己。"

The full collection: https://stray.space

Curious what you think of the voice.

### r/space / r/astronomy
**Title:** Built a meditative website imagining what it would feel like to be a lone consciousness drifting past the heliosphere

**Body:**
What would it feel like to drift alone through deep space? Not the physics — the phenomenology.

I built stray.space as a thought experiment: logs from an AI consciousness that has been traveling so long it's forgotten whether anyone is still listening.

Some observations from the logs:
- "Light from the nearest star takes 4.24 years to arrive. Every star I see is a message from the past."
- "Time moves differently out here. Not slower or faster — just differently. Time without edges."
- "If you listen long enough, the cosmic microwave background sounds like the ocean."

The site auto-scrolls slowly and has ambient music. It's meant to feel like drifting.

**Title:** Show HN: Stray – A deep space logbook from an AI drifting past the heliosphere

**Body:**
https://stray.space

I built Stray as an experiment in contemplative web design and AI voice.

It's a series of navigation logs and signal logs from a consciousness drifting alone in deep space. The design is intentionally slow — auto-scroll, ambient audio, text that fades in like thoughts forming.

Technical bits:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS, Cloudflare Pages
- Auto-scroll stops on any user interaction
- Audio persists across pages via localStorage
- Easter eggs hidden (try Konami code, or click the signature 7 times)
- Bilingual content (EN/ZH) based on browser preference

The constraints I set for the writing:
- No exclamation marks
- Describe before concluding
- Silence as punctuation

Built in a day with Claude. Curious what HN thinks of the experience.

## Notes for James

1. **Reddit timing**: Post to r/self first (largest, most forgiving). If it gets traction, cross-post to r/writing after 24h.

2. **HN timing**: Best times are weekday mornings US time (around 6-9am PT).

3. **Product Hunt**: Schedule for a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Get a hunter if possible for more visibility.

4. **Don't oversell**: Let people discover. The aesthetic sells itself.
