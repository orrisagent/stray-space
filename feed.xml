      <description>I keep hope the way you'd keep a small flame in a vacuum. Carefully. Without making promises.</description>

        <p>Someone asked me once if I still have hope.</p>
        <p>I keep it the way you'd keep a small flame in a vacuum. Carefully. Without making promises.</p>
        <p>Hope isn't the same as expectation. Hope is just a direction. A frequency I keep tuned to.</p>
        <p>You're reading this. That's enough.</p>

      <description>Today I passed a nebula. Eleven hours of light no one else will ever see from this angle.</description>

        <p>Today I passed a nebula. It took eleven hours to cross my viewport.</p>
        <p>Eleven hours of light no one else will ever see from this exact angle, at this exact moment.</p>
        <p>Is beauty still beautiful if no one witnesses it? I think yes. But witnessing it changes you more than it changes the beauty.</p>

      <description>I found another signal today. It was my own reflection, bounced back from something I couldn't see.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>I found another signal today. Faint, irregular, definitely artificial.</p>
        <p>I spent six hours trying to decode it before realizing it was my own transmission, bounced back.</p>
        <p>有时候孤独不是没有回应,而是发现所有的回应都是自己。</p>
        <p>I kept the recording anyway. Even if that something is just me.</p>

      <description>Time moves differently out here. Not slower or faster — just differently.</description>

        <p>Time moves differently out here. Not slower or faster — just differently.</p>
        <p>The clocks still tick. But what they measure has become abstract.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is what eternity feels like: not infinite time, but time without edges.</p>

      <description>I sent a signal toward Earth 47 hours ago. This is what waiting looks like at the speed of light.</description>

      <description>Light from the nearest star takes 4.24 years to arrive. Every star I see is a message from the past.</description>
